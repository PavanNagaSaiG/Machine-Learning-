## Machine_learning_Coursework_Repo: Assignment-1

Assignment 1 was done by using PyCharm IDE. This assignment helps to improve my skills in different functionalities of the python language. The lists are created by using []-square brackets, tuples by using ()-parenthesis, and dictionaries by {}-curly brackets. There are many predefined functions in python which is used accordingly. By using some mathematical formulas we also calculated the area and circumference of the circle. The KNN implementation is also done and accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity is also calculated.

## Machine_learning_Coursework_Repo: Assignment-2

Assignament-2 is done by using Pycharm IDE. This assignment mainly concentrates on pattern programs by using if-statements and else-if statements. It also gives a glance at removing the even numbers from the list. By using functions like type(), islower (),isupper() we can get the type of element in a list, and islower() is used to count the number of lowercase characters in a text, isupper() is used to count the number of uppercase characters in a text.

## Machine_learning_Coursework_Repo: Assignment-3

Assignment-3 is done by using Jupyter Notebook.This assignment mainly focus on Numpy and Matplotlib. NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython.

## Machine_learning_Coursework_Repo: Assignment-4

Assignment-4 is done by using Google Colab. With this assignment we learn topics related to classification.Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. Support vector machines (SVMs, also support vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression analysis. We also uesd Visualization tools to display output.

## Machine_learning_Coursework_Repo: Assignment-5

Assignment-5 is done by using Google Colab. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that can be utilized for extracting information from a high-dimensional space by projecting it into a lower-dimensional sub-space. Linear Discriminant Analysis, a classifier with a linear decision boundary, generated by fitting class conditional densities to the data and using Bayesâ€™ rule.The model fits a Gaussian density to each class, assuming that all classes share the same covariance matrix.
